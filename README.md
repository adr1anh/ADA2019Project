# Mapping of Food Inspection Violations in the City of Chicago:

## Abstract:

The City of Chicago provides a dataset containing the results of food inspections it conducted since January 1st 2010. In total, there are almost 200'000 observations including information about the establishment and inspection results.


Our goal in this project is to visualize the city of Chicago as a graph of the food violation in an appealing and concise way in order to analyse the streets where the most violation occurs. In a second part we can thus use another dataset provided by the Chicago Data Portal such as Crimes - 2001 to present and look for correlation between th district with high crime and food violation.  Through this we hope to gain deeper insight into how the city of Chicago can be analyzed and which implications on the population can be inferred by food violation.

## Research Questions:

How to efficiently create a graph from our dataset?
How to map correlation on a graph?
